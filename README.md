Exploration of using software (specifically Python) to produce images of the kind hand-drawn by Jon Harris ([YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp4ScbYr7qCOFpXwa6VaAkw))

In particular, his line drawings are (to me at least) very relaxing to watch ([example](https://youtu.be/gOoxAJmrXGc)) and I wondered about the possibility of producing something similar in code (the end-product, at least).

So this is that. None of the animation or natural "organic" variation in strike that makes the videos so captivating, but the results have a certain charm of their own, if slightly sterile.

Makes use of [ipycanvas](https://github.com/martinRenou/ipycanvas) for drawing in Jupyter Notebooks.
